Pass-By-Value is a project that showcases how many popular languages pass everything by value.

It is common to say that most modern languages pass primitives by value and objects by reference,
but this is in fact incorrect.

Instead, *object references* are created and stored in variables upon object initialization.
These references themselves are passed by value.

Pass-By-Value will hopefully dispel the myth that certain languages have pass-by-reference
paradigms when in fact they don't.  This belief is harmful to the development community.
